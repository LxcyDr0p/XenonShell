# XenonShell
XenonShell is a CLI based Xbox 360 program specifically designed for consoles running modified software. XenonShell is the successor to an earlier and much more baseline program, XeCmd (https://github.com/LxcyDr0p/XeCMD).
## XenonShell CLI - Functions
XenonShell stands out not only in it's CLI aspect, but in it's functions. XenonShell contains a slew of commands and operations not seen in most RTEs or LANTs. On top of that, XenonShell has been carefully cropped and polished code wise. One of the ultimate goals of this project was to provide smooth, crisp like feels to the functionality aspect of tools such as Guido's or RGStarter, to eliminate the latency, instability and lag. Both on the client and server side.

I will post a full (current) commands list here soon.
